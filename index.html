                <p>From 2022 to 2024, the emissions from 79 popular AI systems were estimated to be up to 102.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. That is comparable to the annual emissions of almost <strong>22 million people</strong>. It also <i>exceeded</i> the carbon emissions of over 137 countries in 2022 (<a href="#Yu">Yu et al., 2024</a>).</p>
                
                <p>If we don’t address AI’s environmental footprint, these emissions are expected to rise substantially, which will in turn worsen the effects of climate change. That is why it is so important to propose solutions to curb AI’s contribution to climate change, especially as it becomes increasingly prevalent in our lives.</p>
                
                <p>So, I write this in appeal to CEOs of AI companies everywhere, consider the following research I’ve done for creating a more sustainable future for both artificial intelligence and our planet.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The first step</strong> to making AI more sustainable comes down to power. AI data centers consume a large amount of power during initial training and ongoing inference, which often relies heavily on fossil fuels and other sources of dirty energy.</p>
                 
                 <img src="AIEnvironmentalImpact.png" alt="AI emissions chart" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; width: 550px;">
                 
                 <p>In fact, over 4% of U.S. electricity consumption is accounted for by 2,132 data centers with 56% of this energy being from fossil fuels. (<a href="#Guidi">Guidi et al., 2024</a>). 
                    To reduce the carbon footprint of AI systems, companies should prioritize transitioning to renewable energy sources as well as dedicating funding for research into better alternatives.</p>
                 
                 <p>One approach companies are taking is using nuclear power. Microsoft, for example, recently signed a deal to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to supply energy for its expanding AI operations, eventually hoping to become carbon negative (<a href="#Microsoft">Reuters, 2024</a>). 
                    While there are some concerns about the long-term sustainability of nuclear power, it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction towards carbon neutrality.</p>
                 
                <p>So, by investing in cleaner and more efficient energy solutions — whether through wind, solar, or nuclear power — AI companies can take a major step towards reducing the environmental impact of artificial intelligence while still allowing for innovation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The second step</strong> to sustainable AI is using AI itself to offset its own environmental impact. While AI contributes to carbon emissions during regular operation, it also has the potential to create solutions that will then mitigate climate change. By using AI to optimize energy grids, carbon capture, and environmental monitoring, companies can help reverse AI’s role in climate change.</p>
                
                <p>For example, AI-driven energy management systems can analyze power consumption in real time and adjust energy use to reduce waste in data centers, as proved by Google’s DeepMind (<a href="#Evans">Evans & Gao, 2016</a>). Other AI models are also being used to optimize carbon capture processes by improving efficiency in identifying and storing CO₂ emissions. Additionally, AI-powered environmental monitoring can track deforestation, air pollution, and other environmental indicators, helping with targeting specific important aspects of combatting climate change</p>
                
                <p>By using AI to help with these environmental challenges, companies can offset the emissions their AI systems generate, making it a tool for combatting climate change rather than contributing to it.</p>

                </div>
                <p><strong>The third step</strong> toward AI sustainability is increasing the efficiency of AI systems so that training and inference use fewer resources. As discussed before, many of today’s AI models require immense computational power, leading to high energy consumption and carbon emissions. By improving model efficiency, companies can significantly reduce the environmental impact of AI without sacrificing performance.</p>
